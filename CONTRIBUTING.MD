# PSAT
The package relies on PSAT. Thus it is stuck with the bad coding practice 
of using scripts, global variables and littering the workspace. Everytime 
there is an interaction with PSAT via global variables or scripts it has to
be clarified in comments.

# Version control

* Guidlines of [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
