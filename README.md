PSAT*: custom modifications were added to the referenced version of the package.



# Installation
Some tips and notes on installing non-trivial dependencies are given below.

## PSAT
PSAT can be downloaded from [http://faraday1.ucd.ie/psat.html](http://faraday1.ucd.ie/psat.html)
however some custom changes/local fixes were added. Consequently, it is recommended
to use the version at [./psat](the local copy).

Upon installation of psat add the psat folder (and its subfolders) to the 
MATLAB path. Make sure to **add PSAT to the bottom** of your MATLAB path list
otherwise internal MATLAB settings will be shadowed.
