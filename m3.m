% this is more like m5 - after directed walks and sampling we check for everything
%% SSS, Directed walks
% Check each setpoint from the previous section. The following criteria has
% to be satisfied to add to the data set as a feasible point (1):
%   o  ACOPF limits are not violated
%   o  SSS is satisfied Sigma_{max} <= \Zets_{min}
%   o  N-1 criteria holds (the above listed are true for all N-1 cases).
% If any of these are violated the set point is labeld as infeasible(0).
%
% Setpoint definition:
% As PowerModels and PSAT both stores variables in unordered fashion an
% internal sorting is performed thus the PG and VG setpoint data can be
% passed as simple vectors.
% The internal sorting will assign the right values to each generator eg.:
%   define setpoints as [.3 .4 .2. .4, 1.1 1.01 1.02 .98]
%                       [    PG      ,        VG        ]
% DIRECTEDWALKS.CHECKSETPOINT will sort the psat generators and assign the
% right values e.g: first generator wll be PG = .3, VG = 1.1
%                   second gen      	   PG = .4, VG = 1.01 etc.
